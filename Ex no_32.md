# EX 32 C program to store any three fruits details such as name,colours& price then display the list of fruits which  belongs to the price greater than or equal to 2000 using structure.
## AIM:
To write a C program to store any three fruits details such as name,colours& price then display the list of fruits which  belongs to the price greater than or equal to 2000 using structure..

## Algorithm
1. Define a structure with members: name (string), color (string), and price (float or int).
2. Input details (name, color, price) for three fruits and store them in an array of structures.
3. Iterate through the array and check if the fruit's price is >= 2000.
4. If yes, print the fruitâ€™s details.
5. End.
   

## Program:
```

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
       
       
        scanf("%s", fruits[i].name);
  
        scanf("%s", fruits[i].color);
    
        scanf("%d", &fruits[i].price);
    }

    // Display fruits with a price greater than or equal to 2000
  
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        if (fruits[i].price >= 2000) {
            printf("Name:%s\n", fruits[i].name);
            printf("colour:%s\n", fruits[i].color);
            printf("price :%d\n", fruits[i].price);
        }
    }
