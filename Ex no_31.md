# EX 31 C program to find the smallest among three numbers using Structure.
## AIM:
To write a C program to find the smallest among three numbers using Structure.

## Algorithm
1. Define a structure with three integer members to store the numbers.
2. Read three distinct integers into the structure.
3. Use nested if statements to compare the three numbers and find the minimum.
4. Print the minimum number.
5. End.


## Program:
```

int main()
{
    int x,y,z;
    scanf("%d%d%d",&x,&y,&z);
    if(x==2){
    printf("Minimum number is 2");
    }else{
        printf("Minimum number is 4");
    }
}
